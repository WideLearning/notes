# open and closed sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable
From [[Lebesgue measurable set]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Every open or closed set is [[Lebesgue measurable set]].

## Proof
- [[intervals are measurable]]
- [[open subset of reals is disjoint countable union of intervals]]
- [[Lebesgue measurable sets are closed under taking complements]]
