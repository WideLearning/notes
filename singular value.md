# singular value
From [[linear algebra]], related to [[eigenvalue]]
$\physics$
## Definition
For $T \in \L(V)$ the singular values of $T$ are the eigenvalues of $\sqrt{T^{*} T}$, each repeated $\dim E(\lambda, \sqrt{T^{*} T})$ times.

## Properties
- There are always $\dim V$ singular values, by [[real spectral theorem]] applied to [[positive operator]] [[square root (of operator)]]
- [[singular value decomposition]]
- [[singular values of self-adjoint operators]] (also works for normal operators)
