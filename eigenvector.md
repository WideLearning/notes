# eigenvector
From [[linear algebra]], related to [[generalized eigenvector]]

## Definition
$v$ is called eigenvector of $T$ if there is an [[eigenvalue]] $\lambda: Tv = \lambda v$.

## Properties
- [[eigenvectors with different eigenvalues are independent]]
- [[adjoint has the same eigenvectors for normal operators]]
- [[orthogonal eigenvectors for normal operators]]
