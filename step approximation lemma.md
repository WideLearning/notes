# step approximation lemma
From [[step function]] and [[measurable function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
For a bounded [[measurable function]] $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ where $I$ is bounded segment and any $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a [[step function]] $h: I \to \mathbb{R}$ and $F \subset I$ such that $\abs{f - h} < \varepsilon$ on $F$ and $m(I \setminus F) < \varepsilon$.

## Proof
Use [[simple approximation lemma]] and then [[approximation of simple function by step function]] with the same $\varepsilon$.
