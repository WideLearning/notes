# Cayley-Hamilton theorem
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$ and $p$ is its [[characteristic polynomial]]. Then $p(T) = 0$.

## Proof
By [[decomposition into invariant subspaces]] we can consider each [[generalized eigenspace]] separately.
We know that $(T - \lambda)$ is [[nilpotent operator]] on $G(\lambda, T)$. Then raising it to $\dim G(\lambda, T)$ will make it zero by [[lemma about sequence of kernels]].
