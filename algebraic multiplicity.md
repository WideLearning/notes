# algebraic multiplicity
From [[eigenvalue]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Algebraic multiplicity of an [[eigenvalue]] $\lambda$ of $T \in \L(V)$ is $\dim G(\lambda, T)$.

## Properties
- It is not less then [[geometric multiplicity]]
- It is the multiplicity of $\lambda$ as root of characteristic polynomial (todo)
- Sum of multiplicities is $\dim V$ (from [[decomposition into invariant subspaces]])
