# injectivity = surjectivity for finite-dimensional linear operators
From [[linear operator]]

## Statement
Suppose $\dim V = n$ (that is, finite) and $T \in \L(V)$ then:
$$\im T = V \Longleftrightarrow \ker T = \{ 0 \}$$

## Proof
By [[dimension test]], [[fundamental theorem of linear maps]] and [[zero-dimensional space is unique]]:
$$\im T = V \Longleftrightarrow \dim \im T = n \Longleftrightarrow \dim \ker T = 0 \Longleftrightarrow \ker T = \{ 0 \}$$
