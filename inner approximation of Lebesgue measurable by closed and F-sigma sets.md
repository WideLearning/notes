# inner approximation of Lebesgue measurable by closed and F-sigma sets
From [[approximation of Lebesgue measurable sets]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Consider $E \subset \mathbb{R}$, the following three are equivalent:
- $E$ is a [[Lebesgue measurable set]].
- For any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a closed $C \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $C \subset E$ and $m^{*}(E \setminus C) < \varepsilon$.
- There exists [[F-sigma set]] $F \subset R$ such that $F \subset E$ and $m^{*}(E \setminus F) = 0$.

## Proof
Same as [[outer approximation of Lebesgue measurable by open and G-delta sets]], up to De Morgan identities and [[Lebesgue measurable sets are closed under taking complements]].
