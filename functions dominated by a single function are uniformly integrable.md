# functions dominated by a single function are uniformly integrable
From [[uniformly integrable]]
$\physics$
## Statement
For a given $g: E \to \R$ consider
$$\mathcal{F} = \{ f \mid f \text{ is measurable on } E, \abs{f} \leq g \}$$
Then $\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly integrable.

## Proof
Use [[lemma about integrals for small subsets]] for $g$ and then by [[linearity and monotonicity of integration]] we get the required inequalities for any $f \in \mathcal{F}$.
