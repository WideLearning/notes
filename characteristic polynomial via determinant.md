# characteristic polynomial via determinant
From [[determinant]] and [[characteristic polynomial]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$ and $p$ is its characteristic polynomial, then:
$$p(t) = \det(tI - T)$$

## Proof
If $T$ has eigenvalue $\lambda$ then $tI - T$ has eigenvalue $t - \lambda$ with the same multiplicity.
So $\det (tI - T) = \prod (t - \lambda_{i})$, as in definition of [[characteristic polynomial]].
