# unit of adjunction
From [[adjunction]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Suppose $F \dashv G$ are [[adjunction]], $F: \cat{C} \to \cat{D}, G: \cat{D} \to \cat{C}$, and consider $\varphi_{A, FA}: \hom_{\cat{D}}(FA, FA) \to \hom_{\cat{C}}(A, GFA)$. Then $\eta_{A}: A \to GFA$ is defined as
$$\eta_{A} = \varphi_{A, FA}(\id_{FA})$$
