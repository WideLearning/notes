# orthogonal projector
From [[linear algebra]] and [[fourier analysis]]
$\physics$
## Definition
For any [[Hilbert space]] $H$ and closed convex $K \subset H$ there is unique $P_{K}(x) \in K$ such that $\| x - P_{K}(x) \| = \inf\limits_{z \in K} \| x - z \|$.
now assume that $K$ is a closed linear subspace (btw, it can be not closed, for example space of polynomials (as functions) on $[0, 1]$ with $l_{2}$ norm).

## Properties
- [[P(x - P(x)) = 0]]
- [[orthogonal projector is additive on K]]
- [[alternative definition of orthogonal projector]]
- [[orthogonal projector is linear]]
- [[KT = (bar K)T]]
- [[Ker P_{bar K} = KT]]
- [[bar K = H ←→ KT = {0}]]
- [[KTT = bar K]]
