From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$. Then a polymonial with minimal degree and leading coefficient $1$ that annihilates $T$ is called minimal polynomial.

## Statement
- [[existence of minimal polymonial]]
- [[annihilating polynomials are multiples of minimal]]
- [[eigenvalues are zeros of minimal polynomial]]
