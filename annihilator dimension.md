# annihilator dimension
From [[annihilator]]

## Statement
$$ \dim U^{0}_{V} = \dim V - \dim U$$

## Proof
Let $u_{[\dim U]}$ be a basis of $U$, then:
$$\varphi(U) = \{ 0 \} \Longleftrightarrow \forall i \in [n]: \varphi(u_{i}) = 0$$
We can extend $u$ with $\dim V - \dim U$ vectors from $V$. Now any $\varphi \in U^{0}_{V}$ must map vectors from $u$ to $0$, but can do anything with others. It gives us the dimension of $U^{0}_{V}$.
