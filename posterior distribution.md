# posterior distribution

From [[terms commonly used in Bayesian statistics]]

It defines what we know about the [[latent variables]] after observing some data related to them. So it's an updated version of [[prior distribution]].

In other words, it's $P(X \mid D)$ from the [[Bayes' theorem]].

Same as with prior, we technically can have posterior for observed variables, but it will just contain the information about the data, so it's not very interesting.
