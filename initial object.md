# initial object
From [[basic definitions from category theory]], dual to [[terminal object]]

## Definition
An object $X$ is called _initial_ (or _universal_) if for every other object $Y$ there is a unique morphism $X \to Y$. Denoted by $0$.

## Properties
- If it exists, it is unique up to isomorphism.
- It is called strict, if any $X \to 0$ is [[isomorphism]]. It is always the case for [[skeleton]], for example.

## Examples
- In [[category of sets]] itâ€™s `Void` (empty type).
