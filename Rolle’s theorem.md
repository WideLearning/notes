# Rolle’s theorem
From [[equalities in analysis]]
$\physics$
## Statement
If $f \in C([a, b])$, differentiable on $(a, b)$ and $f(a) = f(b)$, then:
$$\exists c \in (a, b). f'(c) = 0$$

## Proof
Either we have at least one extremum (strictly) inside the interval, where the derivative will be zero by Fermat’s theorem, or it is constant, so the derivative is zero everywhere.
