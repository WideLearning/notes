# category
From [[category theory]]

## Definition
A category is a collection of objects, collection of morphisms and a composition operation defined on some pairs of morphisms, satisying several properties:
1. domain and codomain of each morphism are objects from the category
2. morphisms $x \to y$ and $y \to z$ can be composed into morphism $x \to z$
3. for every object there is a selected [[endomorphism]] that is a [[unit element]] for composition
4. [[associativity]] for composition
