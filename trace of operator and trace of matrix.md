# trace of operator and trace of matrix
From [[trace]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V), F = \mathbb{C}$, then sum of its eigenvalues is equal to the sum of $[T]_{e}$ for any basis $e$ of $V$.

## Proof
We know that in some basis $[T]$ has [[Jordan form]], and there the diagonal elements are exactly the eigenvalues of $T$ according to their multiplicities. And because [[trace is independent of basis]], it works for any other basis $e$.
