# Lebesgue measurable set
From [[measure theory]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Denote [[Lebesgue outer measure]] by $m^{*}$. Then set $X$ is measurable iff
$$\forall A \subset \R: m^{*}(A) = m^{*}(A \cap X) + m^{*}(A \cap \bar X)$$

## Properties
- [[sets with zero Lebesgue outer measure are measureable]]
- [[Lebesgue measurable sets are closed under taking complements]]
- [[Lebesgue measurable sets are closed under finite union]]
- [[Lebesgue outer measure and disjoint measurable sets]]
- [[countable union of Lebesgue measurable sets can be made disjoint]]
- [[Lebesgue measurable sets are closed under countable union]]
- [[Lebesgue measurable sets are a sigma-algebra]]
- [[intervals are measurable]]
- [[open and closed sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable]]
- [[Borel sets are Lebesgue measurable]]
- [[translate of Lebesgue measurable set is measurable]]
