From [[Lebesgue measurable set]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Consider $A \subset B \subset \R$ and $A$ is a [[Lebesgue measurable set]] with finite measure, then:
$$m^{*}(B \setminus A) = m^{*}(B) - m^{*}(A)$$

## Proof
Because $A$ is measurable:
$$m^{*}(B) = m^{*}(B \cap A) + m^{*}(B \cap \bar A)$$
And because it is contained in $B$:
$$m^{*}(B) = m^{*}(A) + m^{*}(B \setminus A)$$
