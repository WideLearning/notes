# Lebesgue outer measure
From [[measure theory]]
$\physics$
## Definition
$$m^{*}(A) = \inf\left\{ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \ell(I_{k}) \ \Bigg|\ A \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} I_{k}\right\}$$
Where $I_{k}$ are nonempty, bounded (other are useless here) and open, $\ell(I_{k})$ is the length of $k$-th interval given by difference of endpoints. Note that [[summation order for positive numbers]] doesnâ€™t matter.
