# determinant formula and definition match
From [[determinant]]
$\physics$
## Statement
If we denote $\det$ the function from [[formula for antisymmetric polylinear forms]] and set $\det I = 1$, $\det [T]$ will be the product of its eigenvalues, in any basis.

## Proof
Because [[determinant formula is independent of basis]], letâ€™s choose the basis in which $[T]$ has [[Jordan form]]. 
Now, from all the permutations considered in [[formula for antisymmetric polylinear forms]], only the product on the number on the main diagonal is nonzero. And its precisely the product of eigenvalues according to [[algebraic multiplicity]], which is used in [[determinant]] definition.
