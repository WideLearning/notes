# countable maximum and minimum of Lebesgue measurable functions is measurable
From [[Lebesgue measurable function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
For measurable functions $f_{\mathbb{N}}: E \to \R$ their $\max\{ f_{\N} \}$ and $\min\{ f_{\N} \}$ are also measurable.

## Proof
$$\{ x \mid \max\{ f_{\N} \}(x) > c \} = \bigcup_{i \in \N} \{ x \mid f_{i}(x) > c\}$$
Which is measurable, because [[Lebesgue measurable sets are a sigma-algebra]]. And therefore $\max\{ f_{\N} \}$ is measurable by definition.
