# annihilating polynomials are multiples of minimal
From [[minimal polynomial]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$ and $p$ is its [[minimal polynomial]]. Then any $q \in F[x]: q(T) = 0$ is multiple of $p$.

## Proof
If we have another polynomial that annihilates $T$ and is not multiple of the minimal, we can take their gcd and it will has smaller degree.
