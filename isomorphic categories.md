# isomorphic categories
From [[category theory]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Categories $\cat{C}, \cat{D}$ are isomorphic if there is an [[isomorphism]] between them in [[category of small categories]].

## Properties
- Isomorphic categories are always [[equivalent categories]], because they definition is stricter: equivalence allows “up to isomorphism” precison for objects, while here we require that objects correspond to each other exactly.
