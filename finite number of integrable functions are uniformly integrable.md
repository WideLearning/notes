# finite number of integrable functions are uniformly integrable
From [[uniformly integrable]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Let $f_{[n]}: E \to \R$ be a sequence of integrable functions. Then it is uniformly integrable.

## Proof
Consider $g = \sum\limits_{i \in [n]} \abs{f}$ which is also integrable. Then we can apply [[functions dominated by a single function are uniformly integrable]], as $g$ dominates any of $f_{i}$.
