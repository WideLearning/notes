# category of sets
From [[category]]
$\physics$
## Definition
$\mathrm{Set}$ is a category where objects are sets and morphisms are (total) functions.

## Properties
- A[[large category]] and  [[locally small category]]
- [[Curry-Howard isomorphism]] shows that checking whether a set (aka type) has any values in it is equivalent to proving the corresponding theorem. `Void` is `False`, `Unit` is `True`, morphism (function) $A \to B$ is implication from $A$ to $B$, and so on.
