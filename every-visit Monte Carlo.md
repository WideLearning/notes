From [[Monte Carlo methods]]
$\physics$
## Definition
The main difference from [[first-visit Monte Carlo]] is that here we consider the episode return for each of the states in the episode, according to their multiplicity.

## Properties
- Estimates converge at $\order{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}}$ rate, where $n$ is the number of averaged episodes
