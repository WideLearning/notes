# eigenvalue
From [[linear algebra]]

## Definition
$\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue of $T$ if there is an  [[eigenvector]] $v \ne 0: Tv = \lambda v$.

## Properties
- [[number of eigenvalues is bounded by space dimension]]
- [[eigenvalues exist in Cn]]
- [[eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators are real]]
- [[self-adjoint operator has eigenvalues]]
- [[algebraic multiplicity]], [[geometric multiplicity]]
- [[real eigenvalues of complexification]]
- [[nonreal eigenvalues of complexification]]
