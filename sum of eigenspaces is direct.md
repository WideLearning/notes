# sum of eigenspaces is direct
From [[eigenspace]]
$\physics$
## Statement
If $T \in \L(V)$ and $\lambda_{[m]}$ are different eigenvalues of it, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} E(\lambda_{i}, T)$ is a direct sum.

## Proof
Select a basis for each eigenspace. Then vectors inside one basis are independent by definition, and between groups it holds because [[eigenvectors with different eigenvalues are independent]]. So all vectors together are linearly independent and their spans form a direct sum.
