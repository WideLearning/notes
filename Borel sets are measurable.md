# Borel sets are measurable
From [[measurable set]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Every set from [[Borel sigma-algebra]] is a [[measurable set]].

## Proof
Follows from [[measurable sets are a sigma-algebra]] and [[open and closed sets of reals are measurable]].

## Corrolaries
$G_{\delta}$ sets are those which can be represented by a countable intersection of open sets.
$F_{\delta}$ sets are those which can be represented by a countable union of closed sets.
Obviously, they all are Borel sets, so they all are measurable.
