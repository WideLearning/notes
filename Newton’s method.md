# Newton’s method
From [[optimization theory]] and [[solving non-linear equations]]
$\physics$
## Statement
$$f(x_{i+1}) \approx f(x_{i}) + \dd f(x_{i})(x_{i+1} - x_{i})$$
So if we want $f(x_{i+1}) = 0$, we set:
$$x_{i+1} - x_{i} = -(\dd f(x_{i}))^{-1} f(x_{i})$$

## Properties
- [[Newton’s method converges quadratically]]
- [[secant method]] as a modification
