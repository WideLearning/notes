# kernel and image of polynomial are invariant
From [[invariant space]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$ and $p \in F[x]$, then:
- $\ker p(T)$ is an [[invariant space]] under $T$
- $\im p(T)$ is an [[invariant space]] under $T$

## Proof
1. Because [[polynomials of one operator commute]], $p(T)v = 0 \implies Tp(T)v = 0 \implies p(T)Tv = 0$
2. Similarly, $\exists u \in V: p(T)u = v \implies p(T)(Tu) = T(p(T)u) = Tv \implies \exists u' \in V: p(T)u' = Tv$
