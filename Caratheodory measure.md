# Caratheodory measure
From [[measure theory]]
$\physics$
## Definition
For $S \subset 2^{X}$ and $\mu: S \to [0, \infty]$ we can build the induced outer measure $\mu^{*}$ as follows:
- $\mu^{*}(\varnothing) = 0$
- $\mu^{*}(E) = \inf\{ \sum\limits_{k \in \N} \mu(E_{k}) \mid \{E_{k}\} \text{ cover } E\}$

And then the induced Caratheodory measure is the restriction of $\mu^{*}$ to the [[sigma-algebra]] of $\mu^{*}$-measurable subsets of $X$.
