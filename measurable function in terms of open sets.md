# measurable function in terms of open sets
From [[measurable function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
A function $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ is measurable iff $\forall O \subset \R. f^{-1}(O)$ is measurable, where $O$ is an open set.

## Proof
$(c, \infty)$ is an open set, so if we have the property for all open sets, $f$ is [[measurable function]] by definition.

Conversely, [[open subset of reals is disjoint countable union of intervals]]. And a preimage of interval can be represented as intersection of preimages of $(l, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, r)$. Then, [[measurable sets are closed under countable union]], so $f^{-1}(O)$ is also measurable.
