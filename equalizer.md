# equalizer
From [[constructions and operations in category theory]]

## Definition
Equalizer of morphisms $f, g: A \to B$ is a morphism $e: E \to A$ such that $f \circ e = g \circ e$ with [[universal property]]: for another such morphism $h: F \to A$ there is a unique $k: F \to E$ such that $e \circ k = h$.
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}
	F \\
	\\
	E && A && B
	\arrow["{\exists! k}", from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["h"', from=1-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["e", from=3-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["f", shift left=3, from=3-3, to=3-5]
	\arrow["g", shift right=3, from=3-3, to=3-5]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}
```

## Another definition
Equalizer of morphisms $f, g: A \to B$ is a [[monomorphism]] $e: E \to A$ such that $f \circ e = g \circ e$ with [[universal property]]: for another such morphism $h: F \to A$ there is a morphism $k: F \to E$ such that $e \circ k = h$.
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}
	F \\
	\\
	E && A && B
	\arrow["{\exists k}", from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["h"', from=1-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["e", hook, from=3-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["f", shift left=3, from=3-3, to=3-5]
	\arrow["g", shift right=3, from=3-3, to=3-5]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}
```

## Proof of equivalence
$1 \implies 2$:
Suppose $e$ is not [[monomorphism]], that is, $\exists p, q \in \mathrm{Hom}(X, E). e \circ p = e \circ q$. But then we take $F = X, h = e \circ p$ and both $p$ and $q$ are now valid as $k$, which contradicts uniqueness.

$2 \implies 1$: 
By definition of [[monomorphism]] $k$ is necessarily unique ($e \circ k_{1} = h = e \circ k_{2} \implies k_{1} = k_{2}$).

## Definition by limits
It is a [[categorical limit]] generated by a category with two objects $a, b$ and two morphisms $a \to b$ (and identities, of course). 

## Properties
- [[equalizer is unique up to isomorphism]]

## Examples
- In [[category of sets]] the found limit has interesting properties. Let’s call the equializer $c$, it’s projection to the match of $a$ let’s call $p$ and the two functions in pattern match $f, g$. from definition of limit we get that $f \circ p = g \circ p$, so $p(c)$ will be the set on which $f$ and $g$ are equal (the largest of them, which is convenient).
- In [[category of abelian groups]] equalizers can be expressed via kernels and vice versa.
