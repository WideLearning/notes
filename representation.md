# representation
From [[functor]]
$\physics$
## Definition
For a [[locally small category]] $\cat{C}$, a representation of a [[functor]] $F: \cat{C} \to \cat{Set}$ is a pair $(R, \alpha)$ such that $\alpha: \hom_{\cat{C}}(R, -) \to F$ is a [[natural isomorphism]]. $R$ is called the representing object and the functor $F$ itself is called representable in such case.

## Properties
- There is a [[natural transformation]] from $\hom(R, -)$ to any such functor, but it might not be an isomorphism.
- [[lemma about representations]]
