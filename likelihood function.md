# likelihood function
from [[terms commonly used in Bayesian statistics]]

It's $P(D \mid X)$ from [[Bayes' theorem]], and the important point is that the argument here is the value of parameters, $X$, while $D$ is considered fixed. If we take the same $P(D \mid X)$ as a function of $D$, it will be just a density functon (conditional on $X$).
