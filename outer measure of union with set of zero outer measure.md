# outer measure of union with set of zero outer measure
From [[outer measure]]
$\physics$
## Statement
$$m^{*}(A) = 0 \implies m^{*}(A \cup B) = m^{*}(B)$$

## Proof
1. $m^{*}(A + B) \geq m^{*}(B)$: [[outer measure is monotone]]
2. $m^{*}(A + B) \leq m^{*}(A) + m^{*}(B) = m^{*}(B)$: [[outer measure is countably subadditive]]
So $m^{*}(A + B) = m^{*}(B)$.
