# monadicity of algebra
From [[algebra over a monad]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Consider a [[monad]] $(T, \eta, \mu)$ and two functors, $U^{T}: T\text{-}\cat{alg} \to  \cat{C}$ and $F^{T}: \cat{C} \to T\text{-}\cat{alg}$. They are defined as follows:
- $U^{T}(A, h) = A$
- $F^{T}(A) = (TA, \mu_{A})$

Then $F^{T} \dashv U^{T}$ and the [[monad from adjunction]] here is $T$.
