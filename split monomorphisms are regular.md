# split monomorphisms are regular
From [[split monomorphism]] and [[regular monomorphism]]
$\physics$
## Statement
If $f: X \to Y$ is a [[split monomorphism]], it is a [[regular monomorphism]].

## Proof
It is an equalizer of $\mathrm{id}_{Y}$ and $\mathrm{id}_{Y}$. For any other $h: Z \to Y$ we can find $k = f^{-1} \circ h$ that will factorize it.
