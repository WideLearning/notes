# dual basis is a basis
From [[dual basis]]

## Statement
Suppose $V$ is a [[vector space]] and $v_{[n]}$ is a basis there.
Then $\varphi_{[n]}$ such that $\varphi_{i}(v_{j}) = [i = j]$ is a basis of [[dual space]] for $V$.

## Proof
Take $f \in \L(V, F)$. It is representable as $f = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(v_{i})\varphi_{i}$.
And the coefficients are unique, because they are determined by $f(v_{[n]})$.
