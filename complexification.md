# complexification
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Definition for linear spaces
Suppose $V$ is a real [[linear space]]. Then $V_{\mathbb{C}} = \{u + iv \mid u, v \in V\}$ is called its complexification. Operations are defined in natural way:
- $(a + ib) + (c + id) = (a + c) + i(b + d)$
- $(a + ib)(c + id) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$ (for scalars)

## Definition for operators
$$T_{\mathbb{C}}(u + iv) = Tu + iTv$$

## Properties
- $[T] = [T_{\mathbb{C}}]$, only now it is considered as complex matrix
- $(T_{\mathbb{C}})^{n}(u + iv) = T^{n}u + iT^{n}v$
- [[real operators have invariant subspace of dimension 1 or 2]]
