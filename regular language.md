$\physics$
## Definition
A set of strings recognized by a [[finite automaton]].

## Properties
- [[regular languages are closed under union]]
- [[regular languages are closed under concatenation]]
- [[regular languages are closed under Kleene star]]
- [[regular expressions describe regular languages]]
- [[regular pumping lemma]]
- [[regular languages are context-free]]

## Examples
- $\{ 0^{n}1^{n} \mid n \geq 1\}$ is not regular (e.g. by [[regular pumping lemma]])
