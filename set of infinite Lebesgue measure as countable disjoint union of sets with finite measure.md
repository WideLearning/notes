## Statement
If $E$ is a [[Lebesgue measurable set]] with infinite measure, $E$ is the countable disjoint union of measurable sets with finite measure.

## Proof
First, consider the interval cover from the definition of [[Lebesgue outer measure]].
Then, [[countable union of Lebesgue measurable sets can be made disjoint]].
