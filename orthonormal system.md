# orthonormal system
From [[fourier analysis]], extends [[orthogonal system]]
$\physics$
## Definition
A countable set of vectors $e_{1}, e_{2} \dots$ is called orthogonal system iff they have unit norms and have zero pairwise [[inner product|inner products]]. In other words, $\ev{e_{i}, e_{j}} = [i = j]$.


## Properties
- Any countable set of vectors can be made orthonormal by [[Gramâ€“Schmidt process]]
