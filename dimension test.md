## Statement
Suppose $W \leqslant V$, then $\dim W = \dim V \implies W = V$.

## Proof
Let $w_{[\dim W]}$ be a basis of $W$. If $\exists v \in V\setminus W$ then $v \not\in \ev{w}$ and we can extend $w$ with it. But because $\dim W = \dim V$ there exists a smaller basis of $V$ which contradicts [[Steinitz exchange lemma]].
