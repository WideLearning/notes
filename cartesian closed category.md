# cartesian closed category
From [[notes/category]], extends [[caresian category]]

## Definition
Such category must have:
1. [[terminal object]] (kind of zeroth power)
2. [[categorical product]] for any pair of objects (i.e., that must be a [[monoidal category]])
3. [[exponential]] for any pair of objects (like in [[category of sets]] function between any two types is also a type)

## Examples
- [[category of sets]], [[category of small categories]].
- If a category also happens to have [[initial object]], [[coproduct]] and [[distributivity]] of [[categorical product]] and [[coproduct]], itâ€™s _bicartesian closed category_.
