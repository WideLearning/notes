# preorder
From [[algebraic structures]] and [[category]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Equivalently:
- [[set]] + [[relation]] with [[reflexivity]] and [[transitivity]]
- [[category]] with $\abs{\mathrm{Hom}(x, y)} \leq 1$

## Properties
- If there are $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$, $f$ is [[isomorphism]].
- Every morphism from [[terminal object]] and every morphism to [[initial object]] is [[isomorphism]] (that is, they are strict).
- $A \times 1 = A = A \sqcup 0$ (for any category, actually).
- $A \times 0 = 0, A \sqcup 1 = 1$.
- Its [[skeleton]] is [[partial order]]
