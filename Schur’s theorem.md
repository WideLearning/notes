# Schur’s theorem
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V), \dim V < \infty, F = \mathbb{C}$ then $T$ has upper-triangular matrix w.r.t. some [[orthogonal basis]] basis of $V$.

## Proof
First, it’s enough to find at least some basis, because then we can apply [[Gram–Schmidt process]] without losing upper-triangularity of the matrix (because the matrix of Gram-Schmidt is upper-triangular itself). And we already found such basis in [[every operator has upper-triangular representation over C]].
