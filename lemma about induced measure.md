# lemma about induced measure
From [[premeasure]] and [[Caratheodory measure]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Then [[Caratheodory measure]] $\bar \mu: 2^{X} \to [0, \infty]$ induced on $\mu: S \to [0, \infty]$ will be its extension, that is:
$$\forall E \in S. \mu(E) = \bar\mu(S)$$
if and only if $\mu$ is a [[premeasure]] and $S$ is closed under relative complements:
$$\forall A, B \in S. (A \setminus B) \in S$$

Also there is a version for premeasures on semirings, which should be more inclusive.
