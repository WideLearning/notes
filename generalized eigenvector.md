# generalized eigenvector
From [[linear algebra]], extends [[eigenvector]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$ and $\lambda$ is its [[eigenvalue]], then $v$ is a generalized eigenvector iff
$$\exists j \in \N: (T - \lambda)^{j} v = 0$$
Also, we can replace $j$ with $\dim V$ by [[lemma about sequence of kernels]] and get:
$$ v \in \ker (T - \lambda)^{\dim V}$$
