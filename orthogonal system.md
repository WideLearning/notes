# orthogonal system
From [[fourier analysis]], related to [[conjugate system]]

## Definition
A countable set of vectors $e_{1}, e_{2} \dots$ is called orthogonal system iff they are non-zero and have zero pairwise [[inner product|inner products]]. In other words, $\ev{e_{i}, e_{j}} = [i = j]\norm{e_{i}}\norm{e_{j}}$.
