# approximation of Lebesgue measurable set by finite disjoint union of intervals
From [[approximation of Lebesgue measurable sets]]

## Statement
Suppose $E$ is a [[Lebesgue measurable set]] with finite measure and $\varepsilon > 0$, then there is a finite disjoint union of open intervals $O = \bigcup\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} I_{k}$ such that $m^{*}(E \Delta O) < \varepsilon$. Here $\Delta$ means symmetric difference.

## Proof
By [[outer approximation of Lebesgue measurable by open and G-delta sets]] we can spend $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ of our margin to replace $E$ with an open set. Then, because [[open subset of reals is disjoint countable union of intervals]], we can find top $n$ largest intervals such that the length of the rest is smaller than $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and it will be the answer. Note that we used first outer approximation and then inner, therefore we canâ€™t replace symmetric difference in the statement with either outer or inner approximation.

## Simpler proof
By definition of [[Lebesgue outer measure]] we can spend $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ of our margin to replace $E$ with a countable union of intervals. Then we find top $n$ largest such that the length of the rest is smaller than $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and it will be the answer.
