# preimage of Lebesgue measurable function is measurable
From [[Lebesgue measurable function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
If $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$ is a [[Lebesgue measurable function]], $f^{-1}(c)$ is a [[Lebesgue measurable set]] for all $c$.

## Proof
If $c$ is real, $\{ x \in E \mid f(x) = c \} = \{ x \in E \mid f(x) \leq c \} \cap \{ x \in E \mid f(x) \geq c \}$. So the preimage is an intersection of two measurable sets.

If $c = \pm \infty$, the preimage is a countable intersection of measurable sets.
