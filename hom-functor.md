# hom-functor
from [[functors in category theory]]

itâ€™s similar to [[profunctor]], but here for some category $C$ the mapping takes $(a, b)$ (a pair of objects from $C$) to $C(a, b)$ (their [[hom-set]]). so it is a [[functor]] from $C^{op} \times C$ to $Set$. just as we did in [[profunctor]], here we take a pair of morphisms and return a morphism that takes a morphism and composes with that two.
