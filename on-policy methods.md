# on-policy methods
From [[Monte Carlo methods]]
$\physics$
## Definition
A simpler case compared to [[off-policy methods]], where available history is generated by the same policy that is being evaluated or improved. 

## Property
- Often soft policies are used (e.g. [[epsilong-greedy action selection]]), which are gradually shifted towards a deterministic optimal policy. This makes exploration possible.
