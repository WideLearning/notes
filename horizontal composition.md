# horizontal composition
from [[constructions and operations in category theory]]

if we have two functors $F, G$ and two [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] $\alpha :: F \to F', \beta :: G \to G'$ then the [[natural transformation]] from $F \circ G$ to $F' \circ G'$ is called _horizontal composition_ of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
