## Definition
Class $\textbf{NTIME}(t(n))$ contains all languages that are decidable by an $\order{t(n)}$ single-tape [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]. Running time of NTM on a given input is defined as the length of the longest computation branch for it, the rest is similar.

## Properties
- [[exponential upper bound on NTIME]]
