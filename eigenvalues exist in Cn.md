# eigenvalues exist in C^n
From [[eigenvalue]]

## Statement
Let $T \in \L(V), \dim V = n > 0, F = \C$.
Then $T$ has at least one [[eigenvalue]].

## Proof
Consider $v, Tv, \dots, T^{n}v$ for $v \ne 0$. They are linearly dependent and give annihilating polynomial. This polynomial has roots, each of them is an eigenvalue.
