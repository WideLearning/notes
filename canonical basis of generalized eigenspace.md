# canonical basis of generalized eigenspace
From [[generalized eigenspace]]
$\physics$
## Statement
There is a basis of $G(\lambda, T)$ where each vector is mapped by $(T - \lambda)$ either to $0$ or to another vector from this basis.

## Proof
By [[nilpotent operator has sparse upper-triangulate matrix]] applied to $(T - \lambda)$.
