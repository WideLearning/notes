# halting set
From [[computably enumerable set]]
$\physics$
## Definition
$$K_{0} = \{ \ev{x, y} \mid \phi_{x}(y) < \infty \}$$
Where $\phi_{x}$ is a [[computable function]] with [[Godel number]] $x$, and $y$ is a natural number given as its argument, $\ev{x, y}$ means encoding a pair of natural numbers into one. And $<\infty$ means that the function is defined for the argument.

## Properties
- It is [[computably enumerable set]] but not [[computable set]], see [[halting problem]]
