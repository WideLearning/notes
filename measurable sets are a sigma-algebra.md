# measurable sets are a sigma-algebra
From [[sigma-algebra]] and [[measurable set]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Measurable sets are closed under countable unions, intersections and taking complements.

## Proof
Intersections follow from unions by De Morganâ€™s laws, and the other two:
- [[measurable sets are closed under taking complements]]
- [[measurable sets are closed under countable union]]
