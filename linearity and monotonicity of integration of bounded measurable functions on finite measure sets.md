# linearity and monotonicity of integration of bounded measurable functions on finite measure sets
From [[Lebesgue integral]]
$\physics$
## Statment
If $f, g: E \to \mathbb{R}$ are bounded [[Lebesgue measurable function|measurable functions]] and $m(E) < \infty$ then:
1. $\int_{E} (\alpha f + \beta g) = \alpha \int_{E} f + \beta \int_{E} g$
2. $f \leq g \implies \int_{E} f \leq \int_{E} g$

## Proof
Already know [[linearity and monotonicity of integration of simple functions]]. Then, as in [[integrability of bounded measurable functions on finite measure sets]], we express $f$ and $g$ as limits of simple functions, for limits these properties hold, and then we go back from limits of simple functions to bounded measurable functions.
