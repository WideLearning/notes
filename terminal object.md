# terminal object
From [[category theory]], dual to [[initial object]]

## Definition
An object $X$ is called _terminal_ (or _final_) if for every other object $Y$ there is a unique morphism $Y \to X$. It is usually denoted $1$ and for any $X$ morphism $X \to 1$ is denoted $!_{X}$ (same as for [[initial object]]).

## Properties
- By definition, it has only one [[endomorphism]] ($!_{1} = \mathrm{id}_{1}$).
- If it exists, it is unique up to isomorphism.

## Examples
- In [[category of sets]] itâ€™s `Unit` (type with one element).
