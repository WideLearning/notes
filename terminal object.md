# terminal object
From [[basic definitions from category theory]], dual to [[initial object]]

## Definition
An object $x$ is called _terminal_ (or _final_) if for every other object $y$ there is a unique morphism $y \to x$. It is usually denoted $1$ and for any $x$ morphism $x \to 1$ is denoted $!_{x}$.

## Properties
- If it exists, it is unique up to isomorphism.

## Examples
- In [[category of sets]] itâ€™s `Unit` (type with one element).
