# coordinate vector
From [[coordinate representation]]


## Definition
If $v_{[n]}$ is a basis of $V$ and $u \in V$ then its coordinate vector $[u]_{v} \in F^{n}$ is defined as the coefficients of (unique) linear combination expressing $u$ in terms of $v_i$:
$$u = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} v_{i}([u]_{v})_{i}$$
