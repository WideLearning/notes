# divided differences are symmetric
From [[divided differences]]
$\physics$
## Statement
$$\forall \sigma \in S_{n}. [y_{[n]}] = [y_{\sigma([n])}]$$
Note that $\sigma$ is applied both to $x$ and $y$.

## Proof
From [[lemma about divided differences]] we know that any permutation of the first $n-1$ points will not change anything, because interpolating polynom wonâ€™t change. And from [[divided differences are invariant under reversal]] we have reversing permutation. Together they generate all $n$-element permutations.
