# continuous functions are measurable
From [[measurable function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
A function $f \in C(E)$ where $E$ is a [[measurable set]] is measurable.

## Proof
For any open set $O \subset \mathbb{R}$ we have that $f^{-1}(O)$ is an intersection of a domain (which is given to be measurable) and an open set ([[open and closed sets of reals are measurable]]). So the preimage is measurable. Then by [[measurable function in terms of open sets]] we have that $f$ is measurable.
