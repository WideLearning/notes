# invariant space
From [[linear map]]

## Definition
A $U \leqslant V$ is invariant under $T \in \L(V)$ iff $T(U) \leqslant U$. 

## Properties
- $\ker T$ and $\im T$ are invariant under $T$
- Moreover, [[kernel and image of polynomial are invariant]]
- Span of any [[eigenvector]] is one-dimensional invariant subspace
- [[self-adjont operators and invariant subspaces]]
- [[normal operators and invariant subspaces]]
- [[real operators have invariant subspace of dimension 1 or 2]]
