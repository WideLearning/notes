# forgetful functor
From [[functors in category theory]]

## Definition
It is a functor that doesnâ€™t preserve categorical properties of its domain. For example, mapping from [[category of monoids]] to [[category of sets]] where each monoid is mapped to the set of its elements ([[unit element]] and composition are forgotten).
