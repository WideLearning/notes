# measurable set
From [[measure theory]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Denote [[outer measure]] by $m^{*}$. Then set $X$ is measurable iff
$$\forall A \subset \R: m^{*}(A) = m^{*}(A \cap X) + m^{*}(A \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus X))$$

## Properties
- [[sets with zero outer measure are measureable]]
- [[measurable sets are closed under taking complements]]
- [[measurable sets are closed under countable union]] ???
- [[countable union of measurable sets can be made disjoint]] ???
