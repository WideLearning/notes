# category of functors
From [[category]]

## Definition
It is a [[hom-set]] in [[category of small categories]]. Consider two categories $\cat{C}, \cat{D}$. Now the objects will be the [[functor|functors]] between them and the morphisms are [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between those functors. Identities are natural transformations from functor to itself using $\id_{X}$ as component for $X$.

Also it can be defined as [[exponential]] (namely, $\cat{D}^\cat{C}$), because [[category of small categories]] is a [[cartesian closed category]].
