# category of functors
From [[notes/category]]

## Definition
It is [[hom-set]] in [[category of small categories]]. Consider two categories $C, D$. Now the objects will be the [[functor|functors]] between them and the morphisms are [[natural transformation|natural transformations]] between those functors.

Also it can be defined as [[exponential]] (namely, $D^C$), because [[category of small categories]] is a [[cartesian closed category]].
