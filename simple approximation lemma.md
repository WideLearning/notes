# simple approximation lemma
From [[Lebesgue measurable function]] and [[simple function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
For a bounded [[Lebesgue measurable function]] $f$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$ there are [[simple function|simple functions]] $l, r$ such that $l \leq f \leq r$ and $0 \leq r - l < \varepsilon$. Here $f \leq g$ means $\forall x \in E. f(x) \leq g(x)$.

## Proof
Split the image of $f$ into half-intervals less than $\varepsilon$, define $l$ to be the least value of interval on all its preimage and $r$ to be the largest value. All conditions are satisfied.
