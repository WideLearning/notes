# linearity and monotonicity of integration of simple functions
From [[Lebesgue integral]] and [[simple function]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Let $f, g: E \to \mathbb{R}$ be [[simple function|simple functions]] and $m(E) < \infty$. Then:
1. $\int_{E} (\alpha f + \beta g) = \alpha \int_{E} f + \beta \int_{E} g$
2. $f \leq g \implies \int_{E} f \leq \int_{E} g$

## Proof
We might partition $E$ in such a way that on each subset both $f$ and $g$ are constant. Then integrals turn into finite weighted sums for which we can prove it by induction.
