# measure theory
From [[algebra and analysis]]
$\physics$
The extent of knowledge required is nothing like as great as is sometimes supposed. There are three principles, roughly expressible in the following terms:
* Every measurable set is nearly a finite sum of intervals.
* Every measurable function is nearly continuous.
* Every convergent sequence of measurable functions is nearly uniformly convergent.
