# passage of the limit under the integral sign
From [[measure theory]]
$\physics$
It would be nice to have the following theorem:
$$\{f_{n}\}  \overset{pointwise}{\to} f \implies \lim \int_{E} f_{n} = \int_{E} f$$
In general it is not true, but there are some important special cases where it holds.
