# dual map
From [[duality]]

## Definition
For [[linear map]] $T \in \L(V, W)$ its dual $T' \in \L(W', V')$:
$$ T'(\varphi) = \varphi \circ T, \forall \varphi \in \L(W, F)$$

## Properties
- [[dual for composition]]
- [[kernel of dual map]]
- [[image of dual map]]
- [[surjectivity is injectivity of dual]]
- If we have inner product, $T \in \F^{m \times n}$
