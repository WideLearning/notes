From [[functor]]

## Definition
It’s a [[functor]] whose domain is a [[product category]], so it generalizes notion of functor to several arguments.

## Examples
1. If [[categorical product]] exists for all objects, it’s a bifunctor (that simply sticks objects into pairs and applies functions component-wise)
2. If [[coproduct]] exists for all objects, it’s also a bifunctor (it haskell it’s called `Either`).

## Properties
- [[natural transformation for bifunctors]]
