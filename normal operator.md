# normal operator
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Definition
$T \in \L(V)$ is normal iff $TT^{*} = T^{*}T$. In other words, $T$ and its [[adjoint]] are [[commuting operators]].

## Properties
- [[normality test via norm]]
- [[normal + upper-triangular = diagonal]]
- [[adjoint has same eigenvectors for normal operators]]
- [[orthogonal eigenvectors for normal operators]]
- [[self-adjoint operator]] and [[isometry]] are special cases
- [[normal but not self-adjoint operators on real inner product spaces]]
- [[normal operators and invariant subspaces]]
- [[normal operators on real inner product spaces]]
