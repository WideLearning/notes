# isometry
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Statement
$T \in \L(V)$ is an isometry iff $\forall v \in V: \norm{Sv} = \norm{v}$.
They are also called orthogonal operators.

## Properties
- It is a special case of [[normal operator]]
- [[isometries preserve inner products]]
- [[isometries have orthonormal matrices]]
- [[inverse of isometry]]
- [[isometries in C]]
