# category of Haskell types
From [[notes/category]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Object — type in [[Haskell]], morphism — function, almost like in [[category of sets]]. But there are some technical [details](https://math.andrej.com/2016/08/06/hask-is-not-a-category/) that make this definition invalid, at least in strict sense.
