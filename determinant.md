# determinant
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Suppose $T \in \L(V), F = \C$, then $\det T$ is the product of its eigenvalues according to [[algebraic multiplicity]].
And for matrices we can define it to be $\det [T]_{e} = \det T$ where $e$ is some fixed basis for current [[linear space]]. Later we will show that basis is irrelevant, and that there is a formula to calculate the determinant from matrix.
