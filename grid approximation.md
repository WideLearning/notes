# grid approximation
From [[inference methods]]

We build a grid over the support of [[posterior distribution]], find densities in the vertices of this grid, and then work with it as with discrete distribution.

It is rather simple method, and asymptotically unbiased. But it requires exponential time and memory, as the number of variables increases.
