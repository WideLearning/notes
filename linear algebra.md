## Notation
- $\ev{v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n}}$ is a linear span of $n$ vectors;
- $\ev{v, u}$ might also mean dot product, depending on the context;
- $[n]$ is $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, $[m, n]$ is $\{m, m + 1, \dots, n\}$;
-  $W \leqslant V$ means $W$ is linear subspace of $V$;
- $W^{V}$ is the set of maps from $V$ to $W$;
- $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ is the set of linear maps from $V$ to $W$;
- $\L(V) = \L(V, V)$ is the set of linear operators on $V$;
