## Notation
- $\ev{v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n}}$ is a linear span of $n$ vectors;
- $\ev{v, u}$ might also mean dot product, depending on the context;
- $[n]$ is $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, $[m, n]$ is $\{m, m + 1, \dots, n\}$;
- $[i = j]$ is $1$ when $i = j$ and $0$ otherwise (same with other conditions);
-  $W \leqslant V$ means $W$ is linear subspace of $V$;
- $W^{V}$ is the set of maps from $V$ to $W$;
- $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ is the set of linear maps from $V$ to $W$;
- $\L(V) = \L(V, V)$ is the set of linear operators on $V$;
- $v + U$ means shifting vector space $U$ by $v$;
- $V / U$ is [[quotient space]];
- $V'$ means [[duality]];
- $U^{0}_{V}$ is [[annihilator]];
- $[T]_{w}^{v}$ is the matrix representation of $T$ with input coordinates in $v$ and output in $w$;
- $A^{T}$ is the transpose of matrix $A$;
- $E(\lambda, T)$ is [[eigenspace]]; $G(\lambda, T)$ is [[generalized eigenspace]];
- $J_{\lambda, n}$ is [[Jordan cell]] with eigenvalue $\lambda$ and size $n$;
