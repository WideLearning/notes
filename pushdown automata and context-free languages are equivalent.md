# pushdown automata and context-free languages are equivalent
From [[pushdown automaton]] and [[context-free language]]
$\physics$
## Statement
For each [[context-free language]] there is a [[pushdown automaton]] recognizing it, and for each pushdown automaton its language is context-free.

## Proof
1.
Let $L$ be context-free language. We will build ePDA recognizing it, because [[PDA are equivalent to ePDA]]. First we put $S\$$ on stack (start variable on the top and then special symbol). On each step the ePDA will replace the variable on the top nondeterministically according to the rules about it, or if there is a terminal on top, read next input symbol and compare them (reject if not equal). After reading $\$$ it accepts.

Any string accepted by such ePDA can be generated by given CFG (we already know the sequence of rule applications), and any string generated by CFG has a sequence of rule applications, which when rearranged left-to-right (and DFS-like) give an accepting computation branch for this ePDA.

2. [[mPDA are equivalent to PDA]], [[mPDA and context-free grammars are equivalent]]
