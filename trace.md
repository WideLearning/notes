# trace
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V), F = \C$, then $\tr T$ is the sum of its eigenvalues according to [[algebraic multiplicity]]. Also it is the sum of diagonal entries of $[T]$ for any basis, as we prove later.

## Properties
- [[trace of product is commutative]]
- [[trace is independent of basis]]
- [[trace of operator and trace of matrix]]
- [[trace is additive]]
