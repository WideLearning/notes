# inverse of isometry
From [[isometry]]
$\physics$
## Statement
If $T \in \L(V)$ is an [[isometry]], $T^{-1} = T^{*}$.

## Proof
By properties of inverse, it’s enough to show one side, e.g. $T^{*}T = I$. And it’s enough to compare how they act on some [[orthonormal basis]] $e_{[n]}$. And that we can do by comparing their bilinear forms:
$$\ev{T e_{i}, T e_{j}} = [i = j] \implies \ev{T^{*} T e_{i}, e_{j}} = [i = j] = \ev{I e_{i}, e_{j}}$$
