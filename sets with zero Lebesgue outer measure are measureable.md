# sets with zero Lebesgue outer measure are measureable
From [[Lebesgue measurable set]]

## Statement
$$m^{*}(X) = 0 \implies \forall A \subset \mathbb{R}: m^{*}(A) = m^{*}(A \cap X) + m^{*}(A \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus X))$$

## Proof
[[monotonicity of Lebesgue outer measure]]:
$m^{*}(A \cap X) \leq m^{*}(X) = 0$
[[Lebesgue outer measure of union with set of zero outer measure]]: 
$m^{*}(A) = m^{*}(A \cap X) + m^{*}(A \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus X))$
