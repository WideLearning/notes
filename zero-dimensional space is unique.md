# zero-dimensional space is unique
From [[dimension]]

## Statement
$$\dim V = 0 \Longleftrightarrow V = \{ 0 \}$$

## Proof
$\implies$: We have empty basis and by convention empty sums are zero, so the only available linear combination will be zero.

$\impliedby$: The only vector in this space is $0$ and taking it will introduce [[linear dependence]] by definition.
