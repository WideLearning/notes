# RAM and TM are equivalent
From [[Turing machine]] and [[random access machine]]
$\physics$
## Statement
1. Let $M$ be a TM. Then there is a RAM that outputs 1 whenever $M$ accepts the input and rejects or loops forever whenever $M$ rejects or loops forever.
2. Let $R$ be a RAM. Then there is a [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] $M$ that accepts all strings on which $R$ terminates and produces the same output on one of its tapes.

## Proof
Skipped.
