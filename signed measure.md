From [[measure theory]]

## Definition
A signed measure $\nu$ on the [[measurable space]] $(X, \mathcal{M})$ is a $\mathcal{M} \to [-\infty, \infty]$ function such that:
1. Only one of $\pm\infty$ is in $\im \nu$.
2. $\nu(\varnothing) = 0$
3. For a countable disjoint collection $E_{\N}$: $\nu\qty(\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} E_{k}) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \nu(E_{k})$, where the sum converges absolutely if the left-hand side is finite.
