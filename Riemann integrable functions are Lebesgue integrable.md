# Riemann integrable functions are Lebesgue integrable

## Statement
Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function. If it is Riemann integrable then it is Lebesgue integrable (over $[a, b]$) and the two integrals are equal.

## Proof
Riemann integrability means that sup and inf of integrals of step functions are equal. Because each step function is a simple function, sup of simple functions is not less then sup of step functions and similarly inf of simple is not greater than inf of step. So sup and inf of simple must be also equal, moreover equal to the same value as for step functions. So lower and upper Lebesgue integrals match (and have the same value as Riemann), which concludes the proof.
