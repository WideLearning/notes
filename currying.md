# currying
from [[constructions and operations in category theory]]

itâ€™s a transformation from $z \times a \to b$ to $z \to (a \Rightarrow b)$. if we are in [[category of sets]], the second one is equivalent to $z \to (a \to b)$, and what the transformation did was just partially aplying given function. the curred function exists and is unique, by definition of [[function object]].
the opposite is called [[uncurrying]].
