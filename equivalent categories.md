# equivalent categories
From [[category theory]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Categories $\cat{C}, \cat{D}$ are equivalent if there are [[functor|functors]] $F: \cat{C} \to \cat{D}, G: \cat{D} \to \cat{C}$ such that there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between $G \circ F$ and $\id_{\cat{C}}$ (identity functor on $\cat{C}$) and another one between $F \circ G$ and $\id_{D}$ in 

## Properties
- [[alternative definition of category equivalence]]
- Equivalent categories are not necessarily [[isomorphic categories]].
