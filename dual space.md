# dual space
From [[duality]]
$\physics$
## Definition
Consider [[vector space]] $V$, then:
Dual space of $V$ is $V' = \L(V, F)$.

## Properties
- It is a [[vector space]] with the same dimension
- [[dual basis]]
- If you have inner product (which is always the case for finite-dimensional spaces): the natural isomorphism between $V$ and $V'$ is $v \mapsto \ev{v, .}$
- In general, there is an homomorphism from $V$ to $V''$: $\Phi(v)(\phi) = \phi(v)$. It is an isomorphism for the finite-dimensional case.
