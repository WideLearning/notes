# invertibility is equivalent to nonzero determinant
From [[determinant]] and [[invertibility]]
$\physics$
## Statement
Suppose $T \in \L(V)$, then $\exists T^{-1} \iff \det T \ne 0$.

## Proof
Invertibility means that no vector is mapped to zero. It is equivalent to no zero eigenvalues. And it is equivalent to nonzero determinant in our definition.
