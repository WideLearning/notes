# self-adjoint operator
From [[linear algebra]]
$\physics$
## Definition
$T$ is self-adjoint if its [[adjoint]] is the same: $T = T^{*}$
In other words: $\forall v, u: \ev{Tv, u} = \ev{v, Tu}$.

## Properties
- It is trivially a [[normal operator]]
- Self-adjoint operators compared to all operators are as $\R$ compared to $\C$
- [[eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators are real]]
- [[self-adjoint operator has eigenvalues]]
- To get the matrix of adjoint in orthogonal basis you transpose and conjugate it
- [[self-adjont operators and invariant subspaces]]
