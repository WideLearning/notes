# conjugate system
From [[conjugate methods]], related to [[orthogonal system]]

## Definition
A set of vectors $v_{[n]}$ is said to be conjugate w.r.t. a [[positive operator]] $A$ iff:
$$\forall i \ne j: \ev{Av_{i}, v_{j}} \ne 0$$
Equivalently, they are an [[orthogonal system]] w.r.t. the [[inner product]] induced by $A$.
